# arnold-website
My personal website. A little about me and my experiences. 
This one is written in typescript using the angular framework. 

# Deployment
1. After you are finished making your changes, run `ng build --base-href https://tlarnold10.github.io/arnold-website/`
2. Check the `docs/index.html` file to make sure that the base href url is `https://tlarnold10.github.io/arnold-website/`
3. Push to GitHub and merge with the `github_pages` branch. 
4. Check the actions tab to make sure deployment went as expected, should provide you with a URL to test with. 
5. If everything looks good and is working, merge your updates into the `main` branch.
